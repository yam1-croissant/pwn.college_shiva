# What I learnt 
Unlike su, which defaults to launching a shell as a specified user, sudo defaults to running a command as root
Unlike su, which relies on password authentication, sudo checks policies to determine whether the user is authorized to run commands as root. These policies are defined in /etc/sudoers

# Reference 

none.

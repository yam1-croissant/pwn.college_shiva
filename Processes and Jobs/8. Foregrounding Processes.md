To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the 
background, and *then* foreground it without re-suspending it! You can 
background me with Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if 
you're not ready to do that for whatever reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!

Yay, I'm now running the background! Because of that, this text will probably 
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt. Don't panic; just hit Enter a few times 
to scroll this text out. After that, resume me into the foreground with 'fg'; 
I'll wait.

YES! Great job! I'm now running in the foreground. Hit Enter for your flag!

I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running in 
this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         147     136  0 14:39 pts/0    00:00:00 bash /chal
root         149     147  0 14:39 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -f

I don't see a second me!

To pass this level, you need to suspend me and launch me again! You can 
background me with Ctrl-Z or, if you're not ready to do that for whatever 
reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!

Yay, I found another version of me! Here is the flag:

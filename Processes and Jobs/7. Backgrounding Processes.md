I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running *and 
not suspended* in this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID STAT CMD
root         146 S+   bash /challenge/run
root         148 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

I don't see a second me!

To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the 
background, and then launch a new version of me! You can background me with 
Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if you're not ready to 
do that for whatever reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!

Yay, I'm now running the background! Because of that, this text will probably 
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt. Don't panic; just hit Enter a few times 
to scroll this text out.

Yay, I found another version of me running in the background! Here is the flag:

# What I learnt 

every user is a part of group and we can see which groups we are a part of using the 'id' command,
a device file is a special type of files, where interacting with it results in change of something (not chagne in disk storage like a normal file)
often represented as /dev/fb0 type shi

chgrp can be used to change the members of a groupsid

# Reference 
none.

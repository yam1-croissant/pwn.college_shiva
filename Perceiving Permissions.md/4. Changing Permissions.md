# What I learnt 

3 characters denoting permissions for the owning user (now you understand this!)
3 characters denoting the permissions for the owning group (now you understand this as well!)
3 characters denoting the permissions that all other access

r - user/group/other can read the file (or list the directory)
w - user/group/other can modify the files (or create/delete files in the directory)
x - user/group/other can execute the file as a program (or can enter the directory, e.g., using `cd`)
- - nothing

 EXAMPLE- 

 For college_file above, the rw-r--r-- permissions entry decodes to:

    r: the user that owns the file (user hacker) can read it
    w: the user that owns the file (user hacker) can write to it
    -: the user that owns the file (user hacker) cannot execute it
    r: users in the group that owns the file (group hacker) can read it
    -: users in the group that owns the file (group hacker) cannot write to it
    -: users in the group that owns the file (group hacker) cannot execute it
    r: all other users can read it
    -: all other users cannot write to it
    -: all other users cannot execute it
Anyways! Like ownership, file permissions can also be changed. 
This is done with the chmod (change mode) command. The basic usage for chmod is:

chmod [OPTIONS] MODE FILE

chmod allows you to tweak permissions with the mode format of WHO+/-WHAT
where WHO is user/group/other (u,g,o) and WHAT is read/write/execute. 
For example, to add read access for the owning user, you would specify a mode of u+r. 
write and execute access for the group and the other (or all the modes) are specified the same way. 
More examples:

    u+r, as above, adds read access to the user's permissions
    g+wx adds write and execute access to the group's permissions
    o-w removes write access for other users
    a-rwx removes all permissions for the user, group, and world

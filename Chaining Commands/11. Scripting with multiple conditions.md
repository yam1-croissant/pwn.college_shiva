Correct! Your script properly handles all the conditions with elif.
Here's your flag:
pwn.college{Yk2jc9KLwOdSkD5wnlOmyMeTG8Q.0FOzMDOxwiNwAzNzEzW}
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-multiple-conditions:~$
```
```
  GNU nano 8.4        /home/hacker/solve.sh                   
if [ "$1" == "hack" ]
then
    echo "the planet"
elif [ "$1" == "pwn" ]
then
    echo "college"
elif [ "$1" == "learn" ]
then
    echo "linux"
else
    echo "unknown"
fi
